1. Appium
2. WebdriverIO
3. TypeScript
4. mocha
5. Plugins for XCUITest and UIAutomator2

### Setup environment variables:
   * **Mandatory:**
     * APPIUM_APP_VERSION_ANDROID - version of the Android application on which you are planning to run tests (f.e. 2.7.1).

       **NOTE: Binary files of the apps MUST be placed inside `{projectRoot}/apps/` folder. Both binaries for Android and iOS MUST follow naming convention: `Android.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.${appVersion}.apk` and `iOS.Simulator.SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.app.${appVersion}.zip` accordingly.**
       
     * APPIUM_DEVICE_NAME_ANDROID - name of connected Android Device or Emulator on which You are planning to run Android tests (f.e. Pixel 7 Pro)
     * APPIUM_PLATFORM_VERSION_ANDROID - platform version of connected Android Device or Emulator on which You are planning to run Android tests (f.e. 15)

     * APPIUM_DEVICE_NAME_iOS -  name of connected iOS Device or Simulator on which You are planning to run iOS tests (f.e. iPhone SE (3rd generation)
     * APPIUM_PLATFORM_VERSION_iOS - platform version of connected iOS Device or Simulator on which You are planning to run Android tests (f.e. 15)
   
   * Optional:
       * APPIUM_NEW_COMMAND_TIMEOUT - value that will be passed to capabilities' `appium:newCommandTimeout`. Default value: 240
       * WEBVIEW_CONNECT_TIMEOUT - value that will be passed to capabilities' `appium:webviewConnectTimeout`. Default value: 5000
       * APPIUM_WAIT_FOR_TIMEOUT - maximum timeout (milliseconds) to wait for an element during test execution. Default value: 45_000
       * APPIUM_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIMEOUT - maximum timeout (milliseconds) to wait for retrying to connect to Appium server. Default value: 20_000
       * APPIUM_CONNECTION_RETRY_COUNT - maximum tries to retry to connect to Appium server. Default value: 3
       * APPIUM_TEST_TIMEOUT - maximum duration (milliseconds) of single test. Default value: 60_000
 
 ### Run command from within project's root folder:
 * npm run android.app - to run Android tests
 * npm run ios.app - to run iOS tests

## Known issues:
Solution provided doesnâ€™t support localisation. It means that if you change language within the app, tests will stop working since accessibility labels of the app's elements are based on the localised strings. It could be resolved by taking the approach that was used in the source repo of the app e.g.:
```
get cart() {
  return $(`~test-${ this.SELECTORS.cart.label }`);
}
```
